issue,magento/magento2,Added encode diacritics breaks on rp_token,"Issue: Added encode diacritics breaks on rp_token

Descrição: The change from https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/36027/files   seems to be not backwards compatible with existing customer data coming from an earlier Magento version. 

This change validates input with transliteration. However, this is done on every value. Also on values which are not transliterable (is that a word?). Anyway... if we use the Magento API to change an existing customer per following REST API, this translit breaks on the existing `rp_token`.

```
PUT https://www.magento.com/rest/all/V1/customers/:id
```

With body to update the customer including the password like per example.

```

issue,magento/magento2,Grouped products without children not shown and pagination broken,"Issue: Grouped products without children not shown and pagination broken

Descrição: Pagination gets calculated incorrectly when there are grouped products without children.

### Investigation

Upon further investigation I have found the following

1. when calculating the number of products to show, the system will count all grouped products that match, as it should
2. when building the pages, the system then skips the grouped products that do not have a child product

This causes inconsistent paging and results in some products not showing in the catalog listing, though they show fine on direct link. 


### Preconditions (*)

1. Magento 2 site, in my case 2.4
2. Use Grouped products 
3. have more grouped products than your page size
4. have a grouped product that does not currently have children assigned

### Steps to reproduce (*)

1. Go to catalog and look at pagination information

### Expected result (*)

1. Pagination should match the configuration and show the right number of products, including enabled matching grouped products without a child

example for 151 results and 48 page size: pg 1 is 1-48, pg 2 is 49-96, pg 3 is 97-144 etc


### Actual result (*)

1. Pagination does not match the configuration and there are gaps in the pages as the grouped products without children are, for some reason, skipped.

pg 1 is 1-48, pg 2 is 49-92, pg3 is 97-144

issue,magento/magento2,[2.2.4][Performance][Listing][CE/EE] Too much product collection loads,"Issue: [2.2.4][Performance][Listing][CE/EE] Too much product collection loads

Descrição: ### Preconditions
1. Magento 2.2.4 Commerce/Community (same for previous 2.2.x versions, at least tested on 2.2.3)


### Steps to reproduce
1. Install clean Magento 2.2.3+ Community/Commerce with sample data
2. Disable Full Page Cache
3. Add logging to one of these places (this will support repositories & direct collection calls) :
- `Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Product\Collection::_afterLoad()`
- Observe `catalog_product_collection_load_after` event.

It can be very simple & dirty logging, since our objective here is only to fetch amount of collection loads:

`\Magento\Framework\App\ObjectManager::getInstance()->get(\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface::class)->critical('product collection loaded!');`

4. Visit any listing page which contain configurable products. For example:
> /men/tops-men/tees-men.html


### Expected result
1. 30 configurable products on the page = 1 line in the log (1 product collection load).
2. 15 configurable products on the page = 1 line in the log (1 product collection load).
3. 9 configurable products on the page = 1 line in the log (1 product collection load).


### Actual result
1. 30 configurable products on the page = 31 lines in the log (31 product collection loads).
2. 15 configurable products on the page = 16 lines in the log (16 product collection loads).
3. 9 configurable products on the page = 10 lines in the log (10 product collection loads).


After some investigation, I noted that here is specific method, which loaded child product collection for each separate configurable product on the listing page:

`Magento\ConfigurableProduct\Pricing\Price\LowestPriceOptionsProvider::getProducts(ProductInterface $product)`
It's code - http://prntscr.com/jdsxq8

This method called from next places:
1. `Magento\ConfigurableProduct\Pricing\Render\FinalPriceBox::hasSpecialPrice`
2. `Magento\ConfigurableProduct\Pricing\",issue_fechada,"{'labels': ['priority: p2', 'area: catalog', 'area: performance', 'reproduced on 2.4.x', 'reproduced on 2.2.x', 'reproduced on 2.3.x', 'issue: confirmed', 'progress: ready for dev', 'reproduced on 2.1.x', 'severity: s2', 'component: configurableproduct'], 'numero': 15001, 'relevante': False, 'comentarios': 11}",2025-08-06T20:13:48.164125

If that is expected behavior, please tell me how can I manipulate basic_ack and basic_nack/basic_reject within consumers? I also posted the question on StackOverflow: https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/335005/magento-2-rabbitmq-ack-or-reject-message/335023#335023

**Note:** Either I set requeue as **true** or **false** the behaviour is same. Exceptions, don't get requeue whether requeue variable is set as true.

Descrição: This issue is automatically created based on existing pull request: magento/magento2#31955: Make method signature consistent with interface

---------
### Description

The [interface](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4-develop/app/code/Magento/Eav/Api/AttributeManagementInterface.php#L50) uses `$entityTypeCode`. This makes psalm fail without a solution if you are overwriting the method:

With `$entityType`:

```
ERROR: ParamNameMismatch - app/code/My/Module/Model/EavAttributeManagement.php:39:35 - Argument 1 of Yubico\Catalog\Model\EavAttributeManagement::getAttributes has wrong name $entityType, expecting $entityTypeCode as defined by Magento\Eav\Api\AttributeManagementInterface::getAttributes (see https://psalm.dev/230)
    public function getAttributes($entityType, $attributeSetId)
```

With `$entityTypeCode`:

```
ERROR: ParamNameMismatch - app/code/My/Module/Model/EavAttributeManagement.php:39:35 - Argument 1 of Yubico\Catalog\Model\EavAttributeManagement::getAttributes has wrong name $entityTypeCode, expecting $entityType as defined by Magento\Eav\Model\AttributeManagement::getAttributes (see https://psalm.dev/230)
    public function getAttributes($entityTypeCode, $attributeSetId)
```

### Manual testing scenarios

1. Create a class that overwrites `\Magento\Eav\Model\AttributeManagement::getAttributes()`;
2. Run psalm on your file;

Descrição: ### Preconditions and environment

- Magento version 2.4.6, 2.4.7, 2.4.8


### Steps to reproduce


1.  Create a module `MyCompany/MyModule`.

2.  Add a plugin in the `app/code/MyCompany/MyModule/etc/adminhtml/di.xml` file:

    ```xml
    <type name=""Magento\Framework\Model\AbstractModel"">
        <plugin name=""MyCompany\MyModule\Plugin\MagentoFramework\Model\AbstractModel""

                disabled=""false"" sortOrder=""1000""/>
    </type>
    ```

3.  Create the class `MyCompany/MyModule\Plugin\MagentoFramework\Model\AbstractModel`:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace MyCompany\MyModule\Plugin\MagentoFramework\Model;

    class AbstractModel
    {
        /**
         * @param \Magento\Framework\Model\AbstractModel $subject
         * @param mixed $result
         * @return \Magento\Framework\Model\AbstractModel
         */

         */
        public function beforeAfterSave(
            \Magento\Framework\Model\AbstractModel $subject
        ) {
            $a=1;
        }

        public function beforeBeforeDelete(

Thanks for the report and collaboration!

We have tried to reproduce the issue in the latest development branch i.e. 2.4-develop and the issue has been reproducible for us. But it seems to us an expected behaviour.

### Official Documentation Links
**Adobe Commerce DevDocs - Plugin Limitations:** https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/components/plugins/#limitations

This page specifically states:

> Plugins cannot be used on:
> 
> Final classes
> Final methods
> Non-public methods
> __construct
> Virtual types
> Objects that are instantiated before Magento\Framework\Interception is bootstrapped
> Plugins should not be used on:
> 
> Abstract classes
> Methods called from classes that are not a part of the interception system

### Why Plugins Should Not Be Created for Abstract Classes
**Plugins Attach to Specific Implementations:**

Plugins in Magento 2 are designed to modify or extend the behavior of concrete class methods. Since abstract classes do not provide concrete method implementations (only declarations), plugins cannot operate on abstract methods.

Abstract methods must be implemented in a subclass, and it’s the subclass's implementation that gets executed, not the abstract class’s declaration.

**Abstract Classes and Code Behavior:**

An abstract class acts as a blueprint for concrete classes. Plugins cannot be reliably attached to them because there's no guarantee the abstract class's methods will be called in the same way by all implementations.

Let us know in case we missed anything.

issue,magento/magento2,AbstractCarrierInterface::collectRates() has incorrect return signature,"Issue: AbstractCarrierInterface::collectRates() has incorrect return signature

Descrição: ### Summary

[\Magento\Shipping\Model\Carrier\AbstractCarrierInterface::collectRates](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/dc6d0b01fff3988f706f718e16d877bb4b1dea91/app/code/Magento/Shipping/Model/Carrier/AbstractCarrierInterface.php#L24-L31) currently has in its signature that it will return `\Magento\Framework\DataObject`, but technically `\Magento\Shipping\Model\Rate\Result` is used everywhere, and it does not inherit the DataObject, so the signature is, de facto, incorrect.

### Examples

[\Magento\Shipping\Model\Shipping](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/dc6d0b01fff3988f706f718e16d877bb4b1dea91/app/code/Magento/Shipping/Model/Shipping.php#L197-L264):

issue,nopSolutions/nopCommerce,MySQL Container Fails: Identifier name too long in Docker Compose Setup,"Issue: MySQL Container Fails: Identifier name too long in Docker Compose Setup

Descrição: ### Problem Description

I'm trying to run a nopCommerce + MySQL setup using Docker Compose on macOS (Macbook Air - M2 - Arm64). During container startup, MySQL fails with this error:

Setup failed: Identifier name 'FK_CustomerAttributeValue_CustomerAttributeId_CustomerAttribute_Id' is too long

### Environment

- Docker Desktop (macOS)
- MySQL 8.0
- nopCommerce with EF Core

### mysql-docker-compose.yml (partial)

```yaml
services:
  nopcommerce_web:
    build: .
    container_name: nopcommerce
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    depends_on:
      - nopcommerce_database

  nopcommerce_database:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: nopcommerce_mysql_server
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: nopuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: nop123
    volumes:
      - nopcommerce_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  nopcommerce_data:

What I Tried
 - Switched to MySQL 8.0 (And also I tired with MySQL Latest but it didn't work)

 - Simplified the constraint name manually (but not sure where to modify it in EF Core)

 - Verified MySQL is up, but schema fails on setup due to long foreign key names

Help Needed
 - How to override EF Core to use shorter constraint names?

 - Or how to configure MySQL for longer identifiers if possible?

Thanks in advance!

issue,nopSolutions/nopCommerce,"Discount Limitation ""N Times Per Customer"" Not Enforced for Guest Customers","Issue: Discount Limitation ""N Times Per Customer"" Not Enforced for Guest Customers

Descrição: ## Description
In nopCommerce 4.60, the ""N times per customer"" discount limitation is not enforced for guest customers. This allows guest customers to use the same discount code multiple times, even when the limitation is set to 1. This results in revenue loss and undermines discount campaign integrity.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a discount with ""N times per customer"" = 1 and a coupon code (e.g., THANKYOU10).
2. Place an order as a guest customer using the code.
3. Place another order as the same guest customer (same customer ID) and use the code again.
4. The discount is incorrectly applied a second time.

## Expected Behavior
The system should reject the discount code on the second use by the same guest customer and display an error such as ""This coupon code has already been used"".

## Actual Behavior
The discount is accepted and applied successfully for the second order by the same guest customer. No error is shown.

## Root Cause
In `DiscountService.cs`, the limitation check for `DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer` is only performed for registered customers:

```csharp
case DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer:
    if (await _customerService.IsRegisteredAsync(customer))
    {
        var usedTimes = (await GetAllDiscountUsageHistoryAsync(discount.Id, customer.Id, null, false, 0, 1)).TotalCount;
        if (usedTimes >= discount.LimitationTimes)
        {
            result.Errors = new List<string> {await _localizationService.GetResourceAsync(""ShoppingCart.Discount.CannotBeUsedAnymore"") };
            return result;
        }
    }
    break;
```

This check is skipped for guests, so the limitation is not enforced.

## Proposed Fix
Remove the `IsRegisteredAsync` check and always check the usage count for the customer ID, regardless of registration status:

```csharp
case DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer:
    var usedTimes = (await GetAllDiscount",issue_fechada,"{'labels': [], 'numero': 7790, 'relevante': False, 'comentarios': 2}",2025-08-06T20:14:39.437499
issue,nopSolutions/nopCommerce,RedisSynchronizedMemory - Clear cache doesn't clear all servers cache,"Issue: RedisSynchronizedMemory - Clear cache doesn't clear all servers cache

Descrição: When using the Redis Sync Memory caching strategy in a multi-server environment, calling ClearAsync() only clears the cache on the local server where the method is called. The in-memory caches on other servers are notified only of this change. There would be some cache keys in other servers which would not be cleared. 
This issue causes data inconsistency between servers, where some servers may serve stale data after cache clearing operations have been performed on other servers.

When using the Redis Sync Memory caching strategy in a multi-server environment, calling ClearAsync() only clears the cache on the local server where the method is called. The in-memory caches on other servers are not notified of this change.
This issue causes data inconsistency between servers, where some servers may serve stale data after cache clearing operations have been performed on other servers.

comentario_issue,nopSolutions/nopCommerce,Comentário na issue #7742,"Hi team,  

I’d love to contribute to this issue! Adding a **Customer roles** filter to the **Online Customers** page would improve usability and allow store owners to manage customers more efficiently.  

I have a few thoughts on implementation:  
- Should the filter logic be similar to what’s used on the **Customers** page for consistency?  
- Would it be best to allow multi-select for roles and dynamically fetch available roles from the database?  
- Are there any performance considerations we should keep in mind when filtering online customers?  

If no one is currently assigned to this issue, I’d be happy to take it up. Please let me know any additional details or guidelines before I proceed.  

Thanks! 🚀",comentario,{'issue_numero': 7742},2025-08-06T20:14:44.075353

issue,nopSolutions/nopCommerce,Overly broad robots.txt language disallow rule (/{languageCode}*),"Issue: Overly broad robots.txt language disallow rule (/{languageCode}*)

Descrição: ### Description

In `CommonModelFactory.cs`, when generating `Disallow` rules for disallowed languages, the code currently contains:

```csharp
sb.AppendLine($""Disallow: /{language.UniqueSeoCode}*"");
```

While this is syntactically valid, it results in an overly broad rule that may unintentionally block unrelated paths.

---

### 🔍 Example

Given `language.UniqueSeoCode = ""en""`, this line will block:

- `/en/`
- `/en/page`

✅ *(intended)*

But it will also block:

- `/enduro`
- `/engineer`
- `/english-info`

❌ *(unintended)*

---

### ✅ Recommendation

Replace this:

```csharp
sb.AppendLine($""Disallow: /{language.UniqueSeoCode}*"");
```

With a more precise form:

```csharp
sb.AppendLine($""Disallow: /{language.UniqueSeoCode}"");
sb.AppendLine($""Disallow: /{language.UniqueSeoCode}/"");
```

This will block:

- `/en`
- `/en/`
- `/en/...`

But allow unrelated paths like `/engine`, `/enduro`, etc.

---

### 💡 Benefits

- Avoids unintended over-blocking of unrelated URLs
- Aligns with standard path-prefix behavior in `robots.txt`
- Keeps output minimal and accurate

---

I don't think it's correct to trim in the models at all. No other models trim any fields.

The trims were added to catch empty string containing only white space https://github.com/opencart/opencart/pull/1153. The error was that the trim was added to greater than test, when it only needed adding to the less than test, when validating and that some were missed completely..

If you do want to trim the value written to the database, It may be best to to the same a 4.x and trim in the request, although there were side affects.

issue,opencart/opencart,Item removal handler conflicting with coupon removal button in shopping cart,"Issue: Item removal handler conflicting with coupon removal button in shopping cart

Descrição: **What version of OpenCart are you reporting this for?**
4.1.0.3

**Describe the bug**
When viewing the shopping cart, users are able to add coupons, but are not able to remove them. After the coupon removal button exits the ""loading"" status, nothing appears to the user. When inspecting the behavior via the browser dev tools, the actual network request is made to `?route=checkout/cart&language=en-gb`. The coupon's removal button has `formaction=""...?route=extension/opencart/checkout/coupon.remove&language=en-gb""`, so obviously there's an issue here.

Upon further investigation, the issue seems to be that the shopping cart handler for removing products has too broad of a scope, and is catching the event when the coupon removal button is clicked. This is because the coupon stuff is rendered inside the `#shopping-cart` element, and since the removal button has the `.btn-danger` class, and because the shopping cart handler for removing products is applied later than the expected handler in `common.js`, it ultimately undesirably handles the click.

Handler for removing products:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/catalog/view/template/checkout/cart.twig#L66

Coupon removal button:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/extension/opencart/catalog/view/template/checkout/coupon.twig#L15

Intended handler:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/catalog/view/javascript/common.js#L118

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add any product to the shopping cart
2. View the shopping cart
3. Add a coupon
4. Click the button to remove the coupon

**Expected behavior**
The coupon should be removed, and the user should recieve a success alert.

**Server / Test environment:**
 - Local development on the host (no Docker)

issue,opencart/opencart,OpenCart API Access and Allowed Routes: 403 Forbidden Error,"Issue: OpenCart API Access and Allowed Routes: 403 Forbidden Error

Descrição: In OpenCart version 4.1.0.0, the following code block in the catalog/controller/startup/api.php file only allows specific API requests:

```php
$allowed = [
    'api/order',
    'api/subscription'
];
```

Due to this configuration, other API requests, such as api/login, return a 403 Forbidden error.

**Questions**:

- I would like to know if, moving forward, it will be necessary to manually modify the api.php file to add new routes for API access.
  
- I want to understand whether this situation is due to an incomplete development.

Opencart 4.x (all)
**Describe the bug**
Child products (with master_id > 0) are almost useless in native form, difficult to update, buggy, has no fallbacks. 
`variant` and override['variant'] seem to have no practical difference or the idea behind seems faulty.
Stock and price management is an absolute pain.
Having these fields as json makes it impossible by default to filter lists by option availability
Subscription_plan by master or child? (fuzzy because in controlller/product/product is one way, in system/library/cart/cart is another)

I did try my best to explain. I am at a loss with your assessment. I'll try to clarify

The code i provided fixes inconsistence, transforms variations into options catalog side. I copy-pasted from my working code. I kinda hoped someone with dev-eyes to notice that i patched a faulty code and actually made it work into usable variations, with clear indications as to what is wrong and what should be done.

The observations i provided is meant to say: variations are bugged, inconsistent, non-optimized, with no end-purpose, but rather a non-realistic, non-targeted approach, without a clear goal. Someone just... coded and hoped fingers crossed.

$method_data = [];

if ($status) {
    $method_data = [
        'code'       => 'bank_transfer',
        'title'      => $this->language->get('heading_title'),
        'sort_order' => $this->config->get('payment_bank_transfer_sor[UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md)t_order')
    ];
}
```


has changed to:

```
$method_data = [];

if ($status) {
    $option_data['bank_transfer'] = [
        'code' => 'bank_transfer.bank_transfer',
        'name' => $this->language->get('heading_title')
    ];

    $method_data = [
        'code'       => 'bank_transfer',
        'name'       => $this->language->get('heading_title'),

### Describe the bug and add attachments

There is an issue with shipping price taxes when shipping price is returned from external module.

This happens because there is a bug in CartCore class which is returning shipping cost straight from the external module without checking if taxes are used or not:
https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/178c3532f3fa88469cef70e27c66d90185217406/classes/Cart.php#L3596

There should be a check if taxes are used and should be added if needed in if clauses in classes/Cart.php#L3596 and classes/Cart.php#L3611 like there is in the end of the method: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/178c3532f3fa88469cef70e27c66d90185217406/classes/Cart.php#L3671

### Expected behavior

Shipping price taxes should persist

### Steps to reproduce

1. Set ""Free shipping starts at"" for example 20 Eur in Shipping Preferences window;
2. Make sure that external shipping module returns ""10"" in ""getOrderShippingCost"" method;
3. Then add products to cart with total cart sum lower than 20 Eur, then increase to higher than 20 Eur and you will see than shipping price losses taxes; (21% VAT in my example)

* **Server Environment:** Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)
* **File Permissions:** The `admin` folder (renamed to `admin[randomChars]`) has permissions set to `drwxr-xr-x`.

**Additional Information:**

* I have verified that the web server is running and accessible on port 26000.
* No specific error messages are appearing in the web server's error logs related to this 404, or they are generic 404 entries. 
* Front-end of the store (if accessible) seems to be working. (Please confirm if the front end is working or not).

This issue is preventing access to the PrestaShop administration panel, making it impossible to configure the store. Any assistance in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.

### Expected behavior

The backend login page should load successfully, allowing me to enter my credentials.


**Actual Behavior:**

A 404 Not Found error is displayed after redirection to the login URL.

### Steps to reproduce


1. Complete a fresh installation of PrestaShop 9.
2. Attempt to navigate to the backend URL, e.g., `http://81.56.163.216:26000/admin[randomChars]`.
3. The browser redirects to `http://81.56.163.216:26000/admin[randomChars]/login?_token=` and displays a 404 error page.

### Describe the bug and add attachments

I have a store where I have ""visitor"" and ""guest"" client groups, when translating them to estonian, I put them both as ""külaline"" and when I went to change a product category, I saved and it removed one of the groups, as it did not render in the form. this caused categories to behave unexpectedly. disappearing from the main menu and not showing products from that category in lists or other blocks that were using the category.

### Expected behavior

I should be able to translate the groups to be the same string without it causing options to disappear in the admin.

### Steps to reproduce

1. in a different language name customer groups the same.
2. when using that language in the admin go to categories.
3. make some change.
4. save the change.
5. the category disappeared from menu when using private browsing.

issue,PrestaShop/PrestaShop,Trigger based on a category,"Issue: Trigger based on a category

Descrição: # Context
Discounts can be triggered according to the contents of the cart:
1. [1 or more specific products (or one of its combinations)](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/38677)
2. 1 product segment (based on category, [brand](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/38675) or [supplier](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/38674))

Only one category (or sub-category) can be selected.

For the product segment, the relationship between the criteria (category, brand, supplier) that define it is “AND”.

Regarding quantity, for each product selected, the user can specify the minimum number of times one product corresponding to the segment must be present in the cart to trigger the discount. The quantity must be an integer >= 0.

The discount cannot be created if there are no product segment selected.

Modifying the order or the discount after a discount has been applied cancels the discount (if it no longer meets the trigger conditions).

### Describe the bug and add attachments

When submitting an order considered as a free order (Cart rules configured to add free shipping / free products), the following exception is thrown :

Similar issue : [#36926](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/36926)

### Expected behavior

In the [Calculator class](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/8.2.x/src/Core/Cart/Calculator.php), the total order without discount Is calculated without rounding the result and, after that, is subtracted by rounding total. This can have an impact on final price.

Here is the example with 21.525 without tax
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3da4e2b-9c02-4464-a09a-ee18fbac8f9e)

### Steps to reproduce

In clean prestashop 8.2 :
- Create a product with price 21.525000 without tax
- Create a cart rule with high amount (> product price with tax) and free shipping
- Add the product previously created to cart
- add the cart rule previously created 
- try validate order

You can also do it with price 21.525000 with tax for the same bug in front :

### Describe the bug and add attachments

My e-commerce site is built with PrestaShop 8.1.7. For local testing, it runs on a Wamp 3.3.7 virtual server.

When my site is in Production mode:

With PHP version 7.4, I can access the site's index.php page. However, when I click on an element (like a link) on this page, I am instantly redirected to the live, online version of the same site. Additionally, I cannot access the site's Dashboard. This behavior is the same when my server runs on PHP versions higher than 7.4.

When my site is in Debug mode:

When my server is running PHP 7.4, I have full access to the local front office of my site, despite the presence of a few errors, and I can easily access the site's Dashboard.

When the server is running on a PHP version higher than 7.4, I still have full access to the local front office, with a few errors. However, this time when I try to log in to access the Dashboard, PrestaShop gives me a blank page.

How can I solve this problem and access my site's Dashboard in both Debug and Production modes, regardless of the PHP version my server is running?

### Expected behavior

I need to access my site's Dashboard in both Debug and Production modes, no matter which PHP version my server is running

### Describe the bug and add screenshots

In a multishop environment, when logging into the BO as an employee, that has limited access (only some of the shops), I see all the shops in the shop selection dropdown. I should see only shops in the selection that I have access to.

Old shop list is OK, it shows only shops I have access.

### Expected behavior

The list should show only the shop, where the employee has permissions

### Steps to reproduce

Set up a multishop environment, with three shops. Set up an employee that has access to only one or two shops.
Reproduce:
1. Log into the BO as the limited employee.
2. Navigate to Orders - Shopping Carts
    - If the employee has access to two shop, he will see the shop selection dropdown in the top right corner => OK
    - If the employee has access to one shop, he will see `View my shop` in place of the dropdown => OK
3. Navigate to Orders - Orders
4. Notice that the new shop selection dropdown shows all three shops. => This is not correct
5. Select the shop the employee has not access
6. Notice that he is redirected to a shop he has access to => OK

### Describe the bug and add attachments

> ❗️Note: This issue occurs **even if the theme is not the Classic theme**.  
> However, the bug is **not caused by the theme itself**, but by the logic of how ""Add to cart"" is handled in product listings when combinations and minimal quantity are involved.

When a product has **combinations** and a **minimal purchase quantity** (e.g. 3), the **product listings view** (category pages, home, featured products, etc.) always assumes a quantity of 1.

If the user clicks ""Add to cart"" from the product list/card (not from the product detail page), nothing happens, and there is no error shown.  
This results in broken UX and lost sales opportunities.

📸 Screenshots:

<img width=""487"" height=""600"" alt=""Product card showing quantity 1"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447ad7de-8288-4fd3-98b9-bd1ad595c4d6"" />

---

### Expected behavior

The product card should either:

- Display the correct minimal quantity, or
- Redirect the user to the product page to select a valid combination.

If ""Add to cart"" is available directly in the listing, it should respect the minimal quantity set for the default combination.

A proper error message should appear if the quantity is too low.

---

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a product with combinations (e.g. Size: S, M, L).
2. Set the default combination’s minimal quantity to 3.
3. Place this product in a category or home listing.

### Describe the bug and add attachments

Hello,

I have a store running PrestaShop 1.7 and I'm preparing to switch it to PrestaShop 8. I'm preparing for a PHP 8.3.1 environment.
I want to develop this new store locally initially.
I installed Mamp and downloaded Prestahsop 8. After finding several fixes online to make Mamp work, the installation went smoothly until ""Store Installation"" and ""Theme Installation.""
From then on, I consistently get a 500 error: ""1: HTTP 500 - error - {""success"":true,""message"":""""}""

Here are the error logs.
In php_error.log (examples but no fatal error) :

Descrição: ### Shopware Version
 
6.7.*

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

The class [ZugferdDocument](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Checkout/Document/Zugferd/ZugferdDocument.php#L181) uses the line item quantity as basisQuantity for the netPrice. The basis quantity for the price should be 1 and not the quantity of the line item. This will result in wrong ZUGFeRD inovices.

**Example:**

PDF:

<img width=""1788"" height=""108"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00effd18-9683-4766-920b-9506c7263b59"" />

### Expected behaviour

1 should be used as basisQuantity for the netPrice.
The pdf Invoice and the rendered ZUGFeRD invoice should be identical. 

### How to reproduce

Create a ZUGFeRD invoice with a order which contains line items with quantity greater than 1.

issue,shopware/platform,Promotions load all discount and individual codes on detail page,"Issue: Promotions load all discount and individual codes on detail page

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.5.8.18

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

In `Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-promotion-v2/page/sw-promotion-v2-detail/index.js` the promotionCriteria computed value does not set a limit for the discounts and individual codes. Thus the promotions take ages to load, when there is 10k+ codes.

### Expected behaviour

The promotionCriteria should set the limit for discounts and individualCodes to the default (I believe 25 entries). Then the promotion loads like all other promotions, the pagination works afterwards even when changing the amount of codes displayed.

Working fix:
```
        promotionCriteria() {
            const criteria = new Criteria(1, 1)
                .addAssociation('discounts.promotionDiscountPrices')
                .addAssociation('discounts.discountRules')
                .addAssociation('salesChannels');

            // Add limitation for discounts and codes
            criteria.getAssociation('individualCodes').setLimit(25);

            criteria.getAssociation('discounts').setLimit(25).addSorting(Criteria.sort('createdAt', 'ASC'));

            return criteria;
        },
```

### How to reproduce

1. Add promotion
2. Generate individual codes (10k at least, for testing you could do more to see the effect on the load times)
3. Go back to promotions
4. Open the promotion detail page with the newly generated codes

There's many occasion that the search by numeric bring unexpected result due to the fuzziness of the query. It reality, the search by number rarely have a typo.

Create another named ""Product X3800""
Search ""3800"" in the administration:

""Product 3000"" is ranked higher despite of the fact that ""3800"" is more relevant, because ""Product X3800"" is a partial match and ""Product 3000"" is an exact match (with a allowed typo).

issue,shopware/platform,B2B AdvancedProductCatalogs doesn't use correct product listing route,"Issue: B2B AdvancedProductCatalogs doesn't use correct product listing route

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.7.1.1

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

We have updated Shopware to the latest 6.7.1.1 version with the Commercial plugin running at 7.1.0. Our project has a headless approach which means we use the Store-API for all API calls.

With the new AdvancedProductCatalogs plugin we have issues with the product listing call. A decorator (DecoratedProductListingRoute) is used to add some employee stuff but we think this decorates the wrong original class.

Current configuration in the Commercial plugin:

        <service id=""Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute""
                 decorates=""Shopware\Core\Content\Product\SalesChannel\Listing\ProductListingRoute"" public=""true"">
            <argument type=""service"" id="".inner""/>
            <argument type=""service"" id=""event_dispatcher""/>
        </service>

When using the ProductListingRoute class it loses most parameters given by our frontend. So aggregations are not loaded for example, or associations. This also breaks Frontends and no products will show.

We believe it should decorate the ResolveCriteriaProductListingRoute class.

Fix we applied in services.yaml

Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute:
        decorates: Shopware\Core\Content\Product\SalesChannel\Listing\ResolveCriteriaProductListingRoute
        public: true

            - '@Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute.inner'
            - '@event_dispatcher'

### Expected behaviour

The DecoratedProductListingRoute class from the B2B AdvancedProductCatalog plugin should apply the correct class so all data will be resolved.

issue,shopware/platform,Unable to Select Sales Channel for Preview in Publisher – Always Uses First Created One,"Issue: Unable to Select Sales Channel for Preview in Publisher – Always Uses First Created One

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.7.1.2

### Affected area / extension

Extension:Publisher

### Actual behaviour

When clicking the preview button in the Publisher extension, the system always uses the first created sales channel to generate the preview.
This happens regardless of whether the selected content element (e.g., a shopping experience) is even assigned to that sales channel.
There is no option for the user to select the appropriate sales channel for preview purposes. Assignments to other sales channels are ignored.

### Expected behaviour

The preview should either:

respect the sales channel assignment of the content element (e.g., via Shopping Experience assignment), or

provide the user with an option to manually select the desired sales channel for preview.

Falling back to the “first” sales channel in the database is problematic, especially for multi-channel setups, and leads to misleading preview results.

### How to reproduce

Create two or more sales channels (e.g., Store A and Store B).

Create a Shopping Experience and assign it only to Store B.

Open the preview using the Publisher extension.

The preview always uses Store A, even though it is not assigned to the layout.

### Actual behaviour

When the POST call to /api/search/mail-template is made from the Shopware 6.6 backend to edit an email form containing user data (and probably also in similar calls such as the preview for emails, etc., if requested), the backend's response contains the serialized user object in JSON format. Part of this user data is the “password” field, which contains the customer's password hash.

- The hash is sensitive and potentially vulnerable to attack
- Even administrators have no objective reason to view this hash, especially not in an email template preview
- OWASP / GDPR: “Expose only what is necessary.”

The admin should ideally never have the need of seeing the user's password hash, but specifically not in calls like these which might be available to lower-level admin users. Instead, the field should either contain obfuscated information or be removed. 

### Expected behaviour

Instead, the field should either contain obfuscated information or be removed. 

### How to reproduce

To reproduce: 
* Open Backend
* Settings > E-Mails
* Edit an e-mail like ""Registration confirmation""
* Check response for POST /api/search/mail-template call for irrelevant data.

comentario_issue,shopware/platform,Comentário na issue #11531,"Root cause is that in `\Shopware\Core\Content\Flow\Dispatching\Action\SendMailAction::updateMailTemplateType()` we store the whole template data in a JSON field, and then on API level we don't properly seriallize the entities in there and return them as they are 

Fix could be to use `\Shopware\Core\Framework\Api\Serializer\JsonEntityEncoder::encode()` and iterate over the template data and if it is a DAL entity pass it through the encoder so it filters out fields that should not be available in the API

issue,shopware/platform,[COPILOT][FE] - Improve Admin SDK Sidebar,"Issue: [COPILOT][FE] - Improve Admin SDK Sidebar

Descrição: ## Additional things to clarify

- [x] How should the sidebar react on big screens? - Not go into overlay mode immediately, when there is enough screen space. => will be done in layout shifting subticket
- [x] Currently the behavior is really wired, when there is more than one sidebar. Maybe would should think about a solution. => It is not possible to have multiple sidebars open at once (only with same location id - but its an edge case)
- [x] Should the app be able to disable or explicitly need to enable, if it should be extendable? => We decided that the app developer must enable the sidebar to be expandable, by default it should have a fixed size.

### User story

As a admin user, I would like to increase the size of the sidebar, so that I can view content in it more clearly.

### Acceptance criteria

The sidebar should be able to expand as shown in the screenshot.

 Thank you for your report. After careful consideration, we've concluded that this issue does not require immediate attention or isn't something we can address right now. We prioritize openness and clear communication with our community, so we want to be transparent. We may not resolve all reported issues, and this one might remain unresolved. To stay effective, we periodically clean our backlog, and this issue could be closed in the future.

 For now, we'll keep this ticket open to invite further feedback from the community in case we've underestimated its impact and to allow us to revisit it later.

issue,shopware/shopware,ZUGFeRD LineItem netPrice basisQuantity is wrong,"Issue: ZUGFeRD LineItem netPrice basisQuantity is wrong

Descrição: ### Shopware Version
 
6.7.*

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

The class [ZugferdDocument](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Checkout/Document/Zugferd/ZugferdDocument.php#L181) uses the line item quantity as basisQuantity for the netPrice. The basis quantity for the price should be 1 and not the quantity of the line item. This will result in wrong ZUGFeRD inovices.

**Example:**

PDF:

<img width=""1788"" height=""108"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00effd18-9683-4766-920b-9506c7263b59"" />

### Expected behaviour

1 should be used as basisQuantity for the netPrice.
The pdf Invoice and the rendered ZUGFeRD invoice should be identical. 

### How to reproduce

Create a ZUGFeRD invoice with a order which contains line items with quantity greater than 1.

issue,shopware/shopware,Promotions load all discount and individual codes on detail page,"Issue: Promotions load all discount and individual codes on detail page

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.5.8.18

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

In `Resources/app/administration/src/module/sw-promotion-v2/page/sw-promotion-v2-detail/index.js` the promotionCriteria computed value does not set a limit for the discounts and individual codes. Thus the promotions take ages to load, when there is 10k+ codes.

### Expected behaviour

The promotionCriteria should set the limit for discounts and individualCodes to the default (I believe 25 entries). Then the promotion loads like all other promotions, the pagination works afterwards even when changing the amount of codes displayed.

Working fix:

        promotionCriteria() {
            const criteria = new Criteria(1, 1)
                .addAssociation('discounts.promotionDiscountPrices')
                .addAssociation('discounts.discountRules')
                .addAssociation('salesChannels');

            // Add limitation for discounts and codes
            criteria.getAssociation('individualCodes').setLimit(25);

            criteria.getAssociation('discounts').setLimit(25).addSorting(Criteria.sort('createdAt', 'ASC'));

            return criteria;
        },
```

### How to reproduce

1. Add promotion
2. Generate individual codes (10k at least, for testing you could do more to see the effect on the load times)
3. Go back to promotions
4. Open the promotion detail page with the newly generated codes

There's many occasion that the search by numeric bring unexpected result due to the fuzziness of the query. It reality, the search by number rarely have a typo.

How to reproduce:

Create a product named ""Product 3000""
Create another named ""Product X3800""
Search ""3800"" in the administration:

""Product 3000"" is ranked higher despite of the fact that ""3800"" is more relevant, because ""Product X3800"" is a partial match and ""Product 3000"" is an exact match (with a allowed typo).

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.7.1.1

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

We have updated Shopware to the latest 6.7.1.1 version with the Commercial plugin running at 7.1.0. Our project has a headless approach which means we use the Store-API for all API calls.

With the new AdvancedProductCatalogs plugin we have issues with the product listing call. A decorator (DecoratedProductListingRoute) is used to add some employee stuff but we think this decorates the wrong original class.

Current configuration in the Commercial plugin:

        <service id=""Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute""
                 decorates=""Shopware\Core\Content\Product\SalesChannel\Listing\ProductListingRoute"" public=""true"">
            <argument type=""service"" id="".inner""/>
            <argument type=""service"" id=""event_dispatcher""/>
        </service>

When using the ProductListingRoute class it loses most parameters given by our frontend. So aggregations are not loaded for example, or associations. This also breaks Frontends and no products will show.

We believe it should decorate the ResolveCriteriaProductListingRoute class.

Fix we applied in services.yaml

Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute:
        decorates: Shopware\Core\Content\Product\SalesChannel\Listing\ResolveCriteriaProductListingRoute
        public: true
        arguments:
            - '@Shopware\Commercial\B2B\AdvancedProductCatalogs\Domain\SalesChannel\Product\DecoratedProductListingRoute.inner'
            - '@event_dispatcher'

### Expected behaviour

The DecoratedProductListingRoute class from the B2B AdvancedProductCatalog plugin should apply the correct class so all data will be resolved.

issue,shopware/shopware,Unable to Select Sales Channel for Preview in Publisher – Always Uses First Created One,"Issue: Unable to Select Sales Channel for Preview in Publisher – Always Uses First Created One

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.7.1.2

### Affected area / extension

Extension:Publisher

### Actual behaviour

When clicking the preview button in the Publisher extension, the system always uses the first created sales channel to generate the preview.
This happens regardless of whether the selected content element (e.g., a shopping experience) is even assigned to that sales channel.
There is no option for the user to select the appropriate sales channel for preview purposes. Assignments to other sales channels are ignored.

### Expected behaviour

The preview should either:

respect the sales channel assignment of the content element (e.g., via Shopping Experience assignment), or

provide the user with an option to manually select the desired sales channel for preview.

Falling back to the “first” sales channel in the database is problematic, especially for multi-channel setups, and leads to misleading preview results.

### How to reproduce

Create two or more sales channels (e.g., Store A and Store B).

Create a Shopping Experience and assign it only to Store B.

Open the preview using the Publisher extension.

The preview always uses Store A, even though it is not assigned to the layout.

issue,shopware/shopware,Password hash via /api/search/mail-template,"Issue: Password hash via /api/search/mail-template

Descrição: ### Shopware Version

6.6.10.3

### Affected area / extension

Platform(Default)

### Actual behaviour

When the POST call to /api/search/mail-template is made from the Shopware 6.6 backend to edit an email form containing user data (and probably also in similar calls such as the preview for emails, etc., if requested), the backend's response contains the serialized user object in JSON format. Part of this user data is the “password” field, which contains the customer's password hash.

- The hash is sensitive and potentially vulnerable to attack
- Even administrators have no objective reason to view this hash, especially not in an email template preview
- OWASP / GDPR: “Expose only what is necessary.”

The admin should ideally never have the need of seeing the user's password hash, but specifically not in calls like these which might be available to lower-level admin users. Instead, the field should either contain obfuscated information or be removed. 

### Expected behaviour

Instead, the field should either contain obfuscated information or be removed. 

### How to reproduce

To reproduce: 
* Open Backend
* Settings > E-Mails
* Edit an e-mail like ""Registration confirmation""
* Check response for POST /api/search/mail-template call for irrelevant data.

- [x] Currently the behavior is really wired, when there is more than one sidebar. Maybe would should think about a solution. => It is not possible to have multiple sidebars open at once (only with same location id - but its an edge case)
- [x] Should the app be able to disable or explicitly need to enable, if it should be extendable? => We decided that the app developer must enable the sidebar to be expandable, by default it should have a fixed size.

- [x] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.

### Describe the bug

When using the analytics for products, when you search for a single product to see what your sales have been by using the filter, if there is more than one item on the invoice, it's pulling the total number of items sold on that invoice (which is useless info)  instead of just the one product you are trying to get a global sales count for.  It's over inflating your sales.

### Expected behavior

You should only get the number of that products sales.  

### Actual behavior

see above

### Steps to reproduce

I attached the image of the filter analytics I thought.  It’s counting items on that invoice not just the specific product.

issue,woocommerce/woocommerce,Systematic Data Corruption in wp_wc_customer_lookup After HPOS Migration,"Issue: Systematic Data Corruption in wp_wc_customer_lookup After HPOS Migration

Descrição: ### Prerequisites

- [x] I have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.
- [x] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.

### Describe the bug

After activating High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS), we have identified a severe and systematic data corruption in the `wp_wc_customer_lookup` table. For a significant number of registered customers, the customer data (email, name) in this central lookup table does not match the actual billing data on the orders linked to that same `customer_id`.

The root cause appears to be a flaw in the initial HPOS migration process. The script seems to have incorrectly mapped legacy WordPress `user_id`s (from the `_customer_user` meta key) to the new HPOS `customer_id`s. This has resulted in customer profiles in the `wp_wc_customer_lookup` table being mismatched with the orders they are linked to.

The bug is not immediately apparent when viewing a single order in the WP-Admin UI. The order screen correctly displays the billing details from the order's own meta data (`wp_wc_orders_meta`), thus bypassing the corrupted central `wp_wc_customer_lookup` table. The corruption only becomes visible when running aggregate database queries (e.g., for reporting) that must rely on the central lookup table to group data by customer.

Questions for the Development Team
Additionally, I would like to ask for guidance on resolving this issue:

Is there a recommended or built-in way to safely re-trigger the HPOS customer data migration to repopulate the wp_wc_customer_lookup table from the legacy data?

If a re-migration is possible, what is the risk to new orders and new customers that have been created after the initial HPOS activation?

If a re-migration is not advised, is manual correction of the wp_wc_customer_lookup table (via SQL UPDATE statements) the only viable solution?

comentario_issue,woocommerce/woocommerce,Comentário na issue #60214,"Hi @Muttel!

Thanks for reaching out and apologies that you're having trouble. Thanks for all the details you shared about the issue!

It looks like there's some confusion here, may be due to how the `customer_id` column is used across tables. In the lookup table (`wc_customer_lookup`) this is just an internal auto-incrementing value and **does not** correspond directly to the WordPress user ID or the `customer_id` in order tables (`wc_orders`).

To summarize:

- `wc_orders.customer_id` should match the `wp_users.ID` and also `wc_customer_lookup.user_id`.
- `wc_customer_lookup.customer_id` is just an internal ID used only by this table.

Unless you're seeing mismatches in the WooCommerce admin, for example in **WooCommerce > Customers** or when viewing the details for a specific order, it's likely that everything is working as expected. If you are indeed noticing inconsistencies in the reporting or any customer-related data in the admin, could you please share more specifics or examples?

When using the WooCommerce block-based checkout, if a store previously had the phone number field set as optional and a customer saved their shipping address without a phone number, then the store later changes the phone number field to required, the following issue occurs:

* When the customer returns to checkout, their saved shipping address (without a phone number) is auto-filled.
* The checkout form correctly prevents order placement due to the missing required phone number.
* **However, the validation warning for the missing phone number is not visible to the customer because the shipping address section is collapsed by default.**
* The customer must manually expand (""Edit"") the shipping address section to see the validation error and realize that the phone number is missing.

## **To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Set up WooCommerce with block-based checkout.
2. Set the phone number field as optional.
3. Place an order as a customer, saving the shipping address without a phone number.
4. Change the store setting to make the phone number required.
5. As the same customer, go to checkout again. The saved shipping address is auto-filled, but the phone number is missing.
6. Attempt to place an order.

## **Expected behavior**

If a required field (like phone number) is missing from the auto-filled shipping address, the checkout should:

* Either automatically expand the shipping address section to show the validation error,
* Or display the validation error message outside the collapsed section so the customer is aware of the issue.

issue,woocommerce/woocommerce,Support Hierarchy in Filter Options Data Structure,"Issue: Support Hierarchy in Filter Options Data Structure

Descrição: ## **Summary**

Implement hierarchical support for filter options to enable rich taxonomy filtering experiences with expand/collapse functionality, indented display, and tree navigation.

## **Problem Statement**

### **Current Limitation**

> Filter options are currently passed as flat arrays between filter blocks (e.g., ProductFilterTaxonomy) and display blocks (e.g., Checkbox List or Chips). This works for simple filters but prevents the use of hierarchical taxonomy features.

### **Missing Capabilities**

* ❌ Expand/collapse hierarchical categories
* ❌ Indented display showing parent-child relationships
* ❌ Level-specific styling (depth-based CSS)
* ❌ Selective hierarchy expansion

### **Current Data Flow**

```php
// ProductFilterTaxonomy → Display Block
$filter_context['items'] = [
    ['label' => 'Electronics', 'value' => 'electronics', 'count' => 150],
    ['label' => 'Laptops', 'value' => 'laptops', 'count' => 50],        // No parent relationship
    ['label' => 'Gaming Laptops', 'value' => 'gaming-laptops', 'count' => 20], // No depth info
];
```

## **Proposed Solution**

### **Enhanced Filter Options Structure**

```php
// For hierarchical taxonomies
$filter_context['items'] = [
    [
        'label' => 'Electronics',
        'value' => 'electronics', 
        'count' => 150,
        'selected' => false,
        'type' => 'taxonomy/product_cat',
        // NEW: Hierarchy metadata
        'depth' => 0,
        'parent_id' => 0,
        'children_count' => 2,
    ],
    [
        'label' => 'Laptops',
        'value' => 'laptops',
        'count' => 50, 
        'selected' => false,
        'type' => 'taxonomy/product_cat',
        // NEW: Hierarchy metadata
        'depth' => 1,
        'parent_id' => 'electronics',
        'children_count' => 1,
    ]
];
```

## **Benefits**

issue,woocommerce/woocommerce,Product Collection: adjust Product Gallery Next Prev Arrows to be used in Product Collection's carousel,"Issue: Product Collection: adjust Product Gallery Next Prev Arrows to be used in Product Collection's carousel

Descrição: Currently Product Gallery Next Prev Arrows are even namespaced to Product Gallery while I'm reusing them in Product Collection's carousel layout.

The goal of this issue is to:

* make the block name ""agnostic"" to other blocks
* make the block usable by both ""parent"" blocks and potentially others:
  * at the moment block includes iAPI directives strictly related to Product Gallery but the goal would be that this block should define contract, e.g. on-click directives: actions.nextArrowClick, actions.nextArrowClick, while the block above would provide the ""interactivity-content"" through the WP context and parent would be responsible to provide the actions. (Confirm with Billow team).

Outcomes:

* block works in Product Gallery
* block works in Product Collection",issue_fechada,"{'labels': ['blocks/patterns/templates', 'block: product collection', 'block: product gallery'], 'numero': 59626, 'relevante': False, 'comentarios': 0}",2025-08-06T20:17:32.812850
issue,woocommerce/woocommerce,Add to Cart + Options: button shows no animation when adding grouped products to cart,"Issue: Add to Cart + Options: button shows no animation when adding grouped products to cart

Descrição: As mentioned by @dinhtungdu in https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/59364#pullrequestreview-2985878762, when adding grouped products to cart, the *Added to cart* text appears without any animation. We should have a slide up animation like when the *X in cart* text appears.

## **To Reproduce**

1. Go to *Appearance* > *Editor* > *Templates* > *Single Product*.
2. Click on the *Add to Cart with Options* block and update to the blockified version.
3. In the frontend, view a grouped product.
4. Add one of the products to cart.
5. Notice the *Added to cart* text appears without any animations.

![WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/themes/woo/images/logo-woo@2x.png)

Welcome to the WooCommerce Monorepo on GitHub. Here you can find all of the plugins, packages, and tools used in the development of the core WooCommerce plugin as well as WooCommerce extensions. You can browse the source, look at open issues, contribute code, and keep tracking of ongoing development.

We recommend all developers to follow the [WooCommerce development blog](https://developer.woocommerce.com/blog/) to stay up to date about everything happening in the project. You can also [follow @DevelopWoo](https://x.com/DevelopWoo) on X (formerly Twitter) for the latest development updates.

## Getting Started

To get up and running within the WooCommerce Monorepo, you will need to make sure that you have installed all of the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

-   [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating): While you can always install Node through other means, we recommend using NVM to ensure you're aligned with the version used by our development teams. Our repository contains [an `.nvmrc` file](.nvmrc) which helps ensure you are using the correct version of Node.
-   [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation): Our repository utilizes PNPM to manage project dependencies and run various scripts involved in building and testing projects.
-   [PHP 7.4+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php): WooCommerce Core currently features a minimum PHP version of 7.4. It is also needed to run Composer and various project build scripts. See [troubleshooting](DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting) for troubleshooting problems installing PHP.
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md): We use Composer to manage all of the dependencies for PHP packages and plugins.

Note: A POSIX compliant operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) is assumed. If you're working on a Windows machine, the recommended approach is to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us",documentacao,"{'arquivo': 'README.md', 'tamanho': 5221}",2025-08-06T20:17:36.093499
