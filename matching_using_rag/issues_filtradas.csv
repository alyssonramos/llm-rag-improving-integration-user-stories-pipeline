magento/magento2,"Braintree: ""Client token has expired"" error - Token not regenerated automatically on checkout","### Preconditions and environment

-Magento 2 version: 2.4.7-p3
-PHP version: 8.2
-paypal/module-braintree-core version : 4.6.1-p3

-Braintree Payment Method configured with Merchant ID, Public Key, Private Key, and validated Credentials successfully.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Configure Braintree payment in Magento Admin using valid credentials.
2. Leave the site idle for more than 24 hours (token expiry period).
3. Visit the checkout page.
4. Attempt to proceed with Braintree payment.

### Expected result

- Braintree should regenerate the client token automatically if the previous one is expired.
- Checkout should load the payment method without errors.

### Actual result

Checkout displays an error:
`Either the client token has expired and a new one should be generated or the tokenization key has been deactivated or deleted.
`
Simply opening Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods in the admin temporarily resolves the issue.

### Additional information

- We have a storefront built on VueJS, checkout and admin interfaces on Magento 2.
- This issue repeats every Sunday or after site inactivity.
- Admin config visit appears to refresh the token indirectly.
- This could be related to the token lifecycle not being managed properly in Magento’s Braintree module.

### Release note

**Suggestion**
Implement a mechanism to regenerate the client token automatically when expired, especially on the checkout load.

nopSolutions/nopCommerce,MySQL Container Fails: Identifier name too long in Docker Compose Setup,"### Problem Description

I'm trying to run a nopCommerce + MySQL setup using Docker Compose on macOS (Macbook Air - M2 - Arm64). During container startup, MySQL fails with this error:

Setup failed: Identifier name 'FK_CustomerAttributeValue_CustomerAttributeId_CustomerAttribute_Id' is too long

### Environment

- Docker Desktop (macOS)
- MySQL 8.0
- nopCommerce with EF Core

### mysql-docker-compose.yml (partial)

What I Tried
 - Switched to MySQL 8.0 (And also I tired with MySQL Latest but it didn't work)

 - Simplified the constraint name manually (but not sure where to modify it in EF Core)

 - Verified MySQL is up, but schema fails on setup due to long foreign key names

Help Needed
 - How to override EF Core to use shorter constraint names?

 - Or how to configure MySQL for longer identifiers if possible?

Thanks in advance!

nopSolutions/nopCommerce,"Discount Limitation ""N Times Per Customer"" Not Enforced for Guest Customers","## Description
In nopCommerce 4.60, the ""N times per customer"" discount limitation is not enforced for guest customers. This allows guest customers to use the same discount code multiple times, even when the limitation is set to 1. This results in revenue loss and undermines discount campaign integrity.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a discount with ""N times per customer"" = 1 and a coupon code (e.g., THANKYOU10).
2. Place an order as a guest customer using the code.
3. Place another order as the same guest customer (same customer ID) and use the code again.
4. The discount is incorrectly applied a second time.

## Expected Behavior
The system should reject the discount code on the second use by the same guest customer and display an error such as ""This coupon code has already been used"".

## Actual Behavior
The discount is accepted and applied successfully for the second order by the same guest customer. No error is shown.

## Root Cause
In `DiscountService.cs`, the limitation check for `DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer` is only performed for registered customers:

```csharp
case DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer:
    if (await _customerService.IsRegisteredAsync(customer))
    {
        var usedTimes = (await GetAllDiscountUsageHistoryAsync(discount.Id, customer.Id, null, false, 0, 1)).TotalCount;
        if (usedTimes >= discount.LimitationTimes)
        {
            result.Errors = new List<string> {await _localizationService.GetResourceAsync(""ShoppingCart.Discount.CannotBeUsedAnymore"") };
            return result;
        }
    }
    break;
```

This check is skipped for guests, so the limitation is not enforced.

## Proposed Fix
Remove the `IsRegisteredAsync` check and always check the usage count for the customer ID, regardless of registration status:

```csharp
case DiscountLimitationType.NTimesPerCustomer:
    var usedTimes = (await GetAllDiscountUsageHistoryAsync(discount.Id, customer.Id, null, false, 0, 1)).TotalCount;
    if (usedTimes >= discount.LimitationTimes)
    {
        result.Errors = new List<string> {await _localizationService.GetResourceAsync(""ShoppingCart.Discount.CannotBeUsedAnymore"") };
        return result;
    }
    break;
```

This ensures the limitation is enforced for both registered and guest customers.

## Impact
- Major revenue impact for stores running discount campaigns.
- Guest customers can repeatedly use limited-use discount codes.

opencart/opencart,Item removal handler conflicting with coupon removal button in shopping cart,"**What version of OpenCart are you reporting this for?**
4.1.0.3

**Describe the bug**
When viewing the shopping cart, users are able to add coupons, but are not able to remove them. After the coupon removal button exits the ""loading"" status, nothing appears to the user. When inspecting the behavior via the browser dev tools, the actual network request is made to `?route=checkout/cart&language=en-gb`. The coupon's removal button has `formaction=""...?route=extension/opencart/checkout/coupon.remove&language=en-gb""`, so obviously there's an issue here.

Upon further investigation, the issue seems to be that the shopping cart handler for removing products has too broad of a scope, and is catching the event when the coupon removal button is clicked. This is because the coupon stuff is rendered inside the `#shopping-cart` element, and since the removal button has the `.btn-danger` class, and because the shopping cart handler for removing products is applied later than the expected handler in `common.js`, it ultimately undesirably handles the click.

Handler for removing products:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/catalog/view/template/checkout/cart.twig#L66

Coupon removal button:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/extension/opencart/catalog/view/template/checkout/coupon.twig#L15

Intended handler:
https://github.com/opencart/opencart/blob/90dcdfa7503ada4dbfcf41d92b14af36e57b21fd/upload/catalog/view/javascript/common.js#L118

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Add any product to the shopping cart
2. View the shopping cart
3. Add a coupon
4. Click the button to remove the coupon

**Expected behavior**
The coupon should be removed, and the user should recieve a success alert.

**Server / Test environment:**
 - Local development on the host (no Docker)
 - Linux Mint 22.1
 - PHP 8.3.23
 - Brave 1.80.115 (Chromium: 138.0.7204.97)

**Suggested Resolution:**
As far as I can tell, there's two approaches to fix it. I'm willing to do a PR for the fix, but wanted some feedback from others first. Both fixes would be in `cart.twig`.
1. Change the handler scope to use `#output-cart` instead of `#shopping-cart`.
2. Add a dedicated class to the product removal `<a>` elements (e.g. `.remove-item`) and update the handler's selector to use that class instead of `.btn-danger`.",

I installed Mamp and downloaded Prestahsop 8. After finding several fixes online to make Mamp work, the installation went smoothly until ""Store Installation"" and ""Theme Installation.""
From then on, I consistently get a 500 error: ""1: HTTP 500 - error - {""success"":true,""message"":""""}""

Here are the error logs.
In php_error.log (examples but no fatal error) :

### Describe the bug and add attachments

> ❗️Note: This issue occurs **even if the theme is not the Classic theme**.  
> However, the bug is **not caused by the theme itself**, but by the logic of how ""Add to cart"" is handled in product listings when combinations and minimal quantity are involved.

When a product has **combinations** and a **minimal purchase quantity** (e.g. 3), the **product listings view** (category pages, home, featured products, etc.) always assumes a quantity of 1.

If the user clicks ""Add to cart"" from the product list/card (not from the product detail page), nothing happens, and there is no error shown.  
This results in broken UX and lost sales opportunities.

📸 Screenshots:

<img width=""487"" height=""600"" alt=""Product card showing quantity 1"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447ad7de-8288-4fd3-98b9-bd1ad595c4d6"" />

<img width=""705"" height=""344"" alt=""No feedback after clicking Add to cart"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512286d4-9565-4e51-ab61-c81f8e01d836"" />

---

### Expected behavior

The product card should either:

- Display the correct minimal quantity, or
- Redirect the user to the product page to select a valid combination.

If ""Add to cart"" is available directly in the listing, it should respect the minimal quantity set for the default combination.

A proper error message should appear if the quantity is too low.

---

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a product with combinations (e.g. Size: S, M, L).
2. Set the default combination’s minimal quantity to 3.
3. Place this product in a category or home listing.
4. From the product listing, click ""Add to cart"" without visiting the product page.
5. The product is not added, and no message is shown.

### Additional context

We are aware that combination handling in product listings is limited by design, but when minimal quantity is enforced and ""Add to cart"" is visible, the system should not fail silently.  
A safe fallback would be to disable direct cart actions for combination products with constraints, or force redirect to the product page when required.

The current behavior can mislead the customer into thinking the site is broken.

Would you accept a contribution (PR) that disables or redirects the button in these cases?

shopware/platform,Product Description overwriting HTML Code,"### Shopware Version

6.7.1.0

### Affected area / extension

Extension:Commercial

### Actual behaviour

When writing HTML with inline CSS in the product description using the HTML mode, it's possible to create well-formatted and styled layouts.

However, as soon as you switch back to the Standard Editor and make even a small change (e.g. editing a single word), the editor automatically rewrites and strips parts of the custom HTML/CSS code.

Expected Behavior:
The WYSIWYG editor should preserve valid HTML/CSS code written manually in HTML mode, even after switching to or editing within the standard visual editor.

Actual Behavior:
Switching to the Standard Editor and editing content results in:

Inline styles being removed or altered

Custom HTML structure (e.g. <table>, <colgroup>, or styled <td>) being replaced or simplified

Loss of layout integrity

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the product description in HTML mode.

Add a styled HTML block with inline CSS (e.g. table with cell padding or background colors).

Save and switch to the Standard Editor.

Make a small change, like editing a word.

Save again and reopen in HTML mode → custom styles are gone.

Impact:
This behavior makes it difficult or impossible to maintain advanced HTML-based layouts in product descriptions.

### Expected behaviour

If i switch Between HTML to standard Editor side and i write text it shouldt overwrite anything.

### How to reproduce

make a table in the Editor. Go to the html code Editor and change the Table with css. Switch to the standard editor sight and change a word. Save and reload the Website.

shopware/shopware,Product Description overwriting HTML Code,"### Shopware Version

6.7.1.0

### Affected area / extension

Extension:Commercial

### Actual behaviour

When writing HTML with inline CSS in the product description using the HTML mode, it's possible to create well-formatted and styled layouts.

However, as soon as you switch back to the Standard Editor and make even a small change (e.g. editing a single word), the editor automatically rewrites and strips parts of the custom HTML/CSS code.

Expected Behavior:
The WYSIWYG editor should preserve valid HTML/CSS code written manually in HTML mode, even after switching to or editing within the standard visual editor.

Actual Behavior:
Switching to the Standard Editor and editing content results in:

Inline styles being removed or altered

Custom HTML structure (e.g. <table>, <colgroup>, or styled <td>) being replaced or simplified

Loss of layout integrity

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the product description in HTML mode.

Add a styled HTML block with inline CSS (e.g. table with cell padding or background colors).

Save and switch to the Standard Editor.

Make a small change, like editing a word.

Save again and reopen in HTML mode → custom styles are gone.

Impact:
This behavior makes it difficult or impossible to maintain advanced HTML-based layouts in product descriptions.

### Expected behaviour

If i switch Between HTML to standard Editor side and i write text it shouldt overwrite anything.

### How to reproduce

make a table in the Editor. Go to the html code Editor and change the Table with css. Switch to the standard editor sight and change a word. Save and reload the Website.

woocommerce/woocommerce,Mark the ‘Set up payments’ task as in progress on WooCommerce Home when live WooPayments onboarding started,"Currently, the **“Set up payments”** task on the WooCommerce Home screen is not updated to reflect progress when a merchant begins live WooPayments onboarding. As a result, the task may remain in its initial state, even though the onboarding process is already underway.

### **Expected Behavior**

When a merchant initiates **live onboarding** for WooPayments, the “Set up payments” task should automatically transition to the **“in progress”** state.

### **Actual Behavior**

The task remains in its default (not started) state, even after live onboarding is started, potentially confusing merchants or giving the impression that no progress has been made.","Moltres, Onboarding, Task"
woocommerce/woocommerce,[Payments NOX] Store in subdirectory can't switch to live through NOX flow,"## **Describe the bug**

The URL used to disable the current WooPayments test account (`/wp-json/wc-admin/settings/payments/woopayments/onboarding/test_account/disable`) is incorrect for stores installed in a subdirectory (`example.com/store/`). This causes the test account to not be disabled when users click on ""Activate payments"" on the Payments Settings page.

## **To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

* Install WordPress in a subdirectory
* Install WooCommerce and onboard a test account with WooPayments via the WooCommerce > Settings > Payments page.
* Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments and click on ""Activate payments"" and notice that nothing happens (and that there is a 404 fetch POST request in the Network browser logs)

## **Expected behavior**

""Activate payments"" should work.
